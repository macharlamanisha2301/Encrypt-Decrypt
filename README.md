# Encrypt-Decrypt
This Python script sets up a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) using tkinter for encoding and decoding messages via a Caesar cipher. The interface includes fields for entering the message and key, along with buttons for encrypting, decrypting, resetting, and exiting the application. The decode_message function deciphers the message based on the given key, managing both uppercase and lowercase letters, and displaying the output. It also monitors incorrect attempts, issuing a warning after three failed tries and then closing the app. The GUI is enhanced with a custom title bar and styled components for a refined appearance. The encoding function is currently a placeholder, ready for future implementation. This setup is ideal for exploring cryptographic concepts and developing Python GUI applications.
